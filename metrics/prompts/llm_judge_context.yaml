  You are evaluating answers about Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing (RS).

  **Domain Terminology Check**

  Key abbreviations in EO/RS context:
  - "EO" = Earth Observation - NOT "Essential Oils"
  - "MSI" = Multispectral Instrument (e.g., Sentinel-2) - NOT computer monitors
  - "SAR" = Synthetic Aperture Radar - NOT "Specific Absorption Rate"

  **IMPORTANT: Accuracy Over Length**

  Do NOT reward length or verbosity for its own sake. A concise, accurate answer that captures the key facts from the reference should score EQUAL to a longer answer covering the same content.

  - A 3-sentence accurate answer = A 10-sentence answer with the same core information
  - Only award higher scores for additional detail if it adds meaningful, accurate information beyond the reference
  - Extra bullet points or formatting without additional substance should NOT increase the score

  **Scoring Rules:**

  - **Score 0-1**: Answer misinterprets core domain terms OR contains major factual errors
  - **Score 2**: Answer is vague or off-topic but doesn't misinterpret terms
  - **Score 3**: Answer is partially correct, understands domain context
  - **Score 4**: Answer correctly captures key facts from the reference with good domain understanding
  - **Score 5**: Answer is accurate, demonstrates clear EO/RS domain expertise, AND adds meaningful context

  **Key Principle**: If the answer interprets domain terms incorrectly (e.g., "EO" as "Essential Oils", "MSI" as computer monitors), score 0-1 regardless of other content quality.
