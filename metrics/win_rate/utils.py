**Task**: Determine if each answer is CORRECT or INCORRECT.

**Focus on Correctness, NOT Form**:
- Evaluate based on factual accuracy, not writing style, length, or formatting
- A short, accurate answer is just as correct as a long, detailed one

**Evaluation Criteria**:

An answer is **CORRECT (True)** if:
- It captures the key factual information
- Domain terminology is used correctly (e.g., "EO" = Earth Observation, "MSI" = Multispectral Instrument, "SAR" = Synthetic Aperture Radar)
- No major factual errors or contradictions
- The core meaning is correct, regardless of length or style

An answer is **INCORRECT (False)** if:
- It misinterprets domain terminology (e.g., "EO" as "Essential Oils")
- Contains major factual errors or contradictions
- Misses critical information that fundamentally changes the answer
- States "I don't know" or equivalent when a factual answer is expected

**Important**: Judge based on correctness only. Do not penalize for being concise or reward for being verbose.

Question: "{question}"

Answer A: "{answer_a}"
Answer B: "{answer_b}"

Provide your evaluation with:
- answer_a_correct: boolean (true if Answer A is correct, false otherwise)
- answer_b_correct: boolean (true if Answer B is correct, false otherwise)
- rationale: string explaining your reasoning
