question,answer
What are the impacts of a warming climate on the cryosphere?,"Global warming causes melting of ice on land such as glaciers, and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. This adds water to the ocean, and raises global sea levels. Ice and snow reflect sunlight and have a cooling effect on the climate. Without ice, darker land and ocean absorbs heat and amplifies climate change. Thawing permafrost releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases, causing further warming. Human populations living off or close to the sea will be affected as well as population within mountain regions."
