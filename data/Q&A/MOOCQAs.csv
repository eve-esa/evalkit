Question,Answer
"What are the impacts of a warming climate on the cryosphere?

Global warming causes melting of ice on land such as glaciers, and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. This adds water to the ocean, and raises global sea levels
Ice and snow reflect sunlight and have a cooling effect on the climate. Without ice, darker land and ocean absorbs heat and amplifies climate change.
Thawing permafrost releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases, causing further warming
Human populations living off or close to the sea will be affected as well as population within mountain regions","A, B, C, D"
"What is ice and snow albedo?

Albedo is the measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed
Albedo is the measure the thickness of ice or snow
Albedo is the temperature of ice or snow
Albedo is the ratio between frozen water and snow",A
"How does the cryosphere interact with the atmosphere?

The atmosphere and the cryosphere do notinteract with each other
Some parts of the cryosphere interact with the atmosphere
The atmosphere and the cryosphere are the same thing
The atmosphere and the cryosphere are two key components of the Earth’s system and they have complex interactions",D
"How are earth observations of the cryosphere used practically?

To monitor conditions for tourism and recreation 
To help with wildlife management","A, B, C, D"
"What is the benefit of monitoring the cryosphere using SAR instruments?

SAR instruments are cheaper than other instruments 
SAR instruments measure more precisely than optical instruments 
SAR instruments are not weather dependent and can penetrate cloud cover
Data from SAR instruments is easier to interpret and can therefore be used more widely than data from other instruments",C
"What is the difference between sea ice and icebergs?

Sea ice and icebergs are the same thing because they both float on the ocean
Icebergs are colder than sea ice 
Icebergs consist of older sea ice, whereas sea ice is always young and melts quickly
Sea ice forms on ocean water, but icebergs break off from larger formations such as glaciers",D
"How does melting sea ice effect the ocean’s circulation system?

When sea ice melts, it makes the sea water less salty and therefore less dense. This means the water sinks and disrupts the ocean’s circulation system
When sea ice melts, it makes the ocean water cleaner and increases the rate of ocean circulation
When sea ice melts, it makes the sea water more salty and therefore more dense. This means the water floats  and disrupts the ocean’s circulation system
When sea ice melts, the ocean dramatically drops in temperature and stops circulating",A
"Why does satellite data play a crucial part for monitoring climate change?

Satellites are the only reliable tools used for monitoring climate change as they give authoritative and unique insights about the Earth’s climate from space
Satellites are used in conjunction with other data collection tools and methods by scientists to verify models and predictions to help scientists understand, analyse and predict the impact of climate change.
Satellites are the only way to retrieve precise data from remote areas such as Antarctica in order to monitor climate change
Satellites are more economically viable than sending lots of scientists to remote areas such as Antarctica",B
"Sea ice extent is based on whether and area is ‘ice-covered’ or ‘not ice-covered’. What do current studies suggest is happening to sea ice extent?

Sea ice extent has remained approximately the same for the last 30 years 
Sea ice extent has decreased slightly over the last 30 years 
Sea ice extent has dropped rapidly over the last 30 years",D
"What is the relationship between multi-year sea ice and climate change?

Decreasing multi-year ice is a natural process, it is not related to climate change
Decreasing multi-year ice means that there is more first-year sea ice which is positive, because first-year sea ice is stronger than multi-year sea ice
Decreasing multi-year ice operates in a negative feedback loop, which accelerates the warming of the planet
Decreasing multi-year ice operates in positive feedback loop, which decelerates the warming of the planet",C
"With Satellite data allowing us to access data about remote regions and on an unprecedented scale why is it important for scientists to conduct field research?

Satellites are reliable sources of data but they cannot tell us crucial information about what exists under, or in the Earth’s surface
Satellites have consistently proven to give unreliable data, and scientists much constantly check that the data is correct
Satellites are reliable sources of data, which means that the only role of the research scientist is to be a data verifier.
Satellites are reliable sources of data but they are expensive to maintain, so scientists must continue work in the field until satellites are more economically viable for space organisations.",A
"What instrument does CryoSat-2 use to measure sea ice thickness?

"Why is it important for scientists to be able to measure snow on sea ice?

If there is more snow on the sea ice, it is harder to get ships into the area 
Snow pushes sea ice down and makes taking thickness measurements more difficult 
Snow makes sea ice melt and scientists needs to keep track of this effect 
Snow on sea ice causes a degree of inaccuracy in satellite measurements and scientists need to calibrate this, so their measurements from satellites can be accurate",B
"Which of these facts about ice cores is not true?

Most ice core records come from Antarctica and Greenland
Ice cores are cylinders of ice drilled out of an ice sheet or glacier.
Ice cores enclose small bubbles of air that contain a sample of the atmosphere measuring the past’s concentration of gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere.
Ice cores tell us about the past climate up to 250 years.",D

"Which statement is not true about the way we can use data about ice velocity to understand changes in our climate?  

Ice velocity maps can be created by SAR data from Sentinel-1
Velocity ice maps are only created by a series of localised field measurements recorded by scientists 
Ice velocity maps show us the direction and pace of moving ice 
Remote sensing techniques that use SAR and optical satellite data derive accurate surface velocities of remote areas on a regular basis",B
"What are ice shelves?

Because Sentinel-5P had made errors in 2020 so the measurements were not accurate
Because it was found that meteorology supported low NO2 values for Spring 2020 compared to Spring 2019, and this was already being experienced in February 2020, before most areas had entered lockdowns

Because these are trace gasses and so the amounts of them in the atmosphere are hard to measure accurately",A
