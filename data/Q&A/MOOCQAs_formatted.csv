"Why did COVID-19 have an impact on the atmosphere?

A) The COVID-19 virus which spread globally produces gasses which change atmospheric composition
B) The spread of COVID-19 meant many governments took measures to control the virus. Measures such as the restriction of travel, had an impact on anthropogenic emissions in the atmosphere
C) The COVID-19 Virus led most industries to increase their production for online sales, therefore we see an increase in emissions on a global scale.",B
"What did scientists hypothesise about Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels during the lockdown period?

A) An increased spread of NO₂ due to an increased spread of day time population with dispersed residential buildings heating their spaces individually.
B) C. An increase in NO₂ due to a higher number of people working from home.
C) A reduction in NO₂ due to a decrease in vehicle traffic.
D) No change in NO₂ levels because the lockdown would have impact on air quality.",C
"Why couldn’t the initial decreases in NO₂ measurements found over China, South Korea, northern Italy and the US in Spring 2020 compared to Spring 2019, from Sentinel-5P columns, be directly attributed to COVID-19 lockdown measures?

A) Because Sentinel-5P had made errors in 2020 so the measurements were not accurate
B) Because it was found that meteorology supported low NO2 values for Spring 2020 compared to Spring 2019, and this was already being experienced in February 2020, before most areas had entered lockdowns
C) Because these decreases were attributed to 2020 Spring storms which decreased NO2 amounts in the atmosphere worldwide.",B
"How did the NO2 COVID study solve the problem of finding out if NO2 distributions are influenced by COVID lockdowns, and not by meteorology only?

A) By looking at and comparing very short term (monthly) NO2 emission estimates rather than long-term (several years or months), which was made possible by TROPOMI’s high spatial resolution
B) By looking at and comparing long-term emission estimates (years), so we could see the larger pattern of NO2 emissions.
C) By seeing what the sources of NO2 were by looking at satellite imagery, which was made possible by TROPOMI’s high spatial resolution",A
"True or false: Though we can estimate changes in Nitrogen Dioxide in the atmosphere from Space using satellites, they cannot tell us about the sources and why the change occurred.

A) True
B) False",A
"What is the primary source of carbon dioxide emissions?

A) Agriculture
B) Burning of fossil fuels, oil, coal and gas
C) Vehicle traffic",B
"Why was it a challenge to use satellite data (from OCO-2 and GOSAT) to obtain information on COVID-19 related CO2 emission reductions?

A) Because these satellites have very high resolutions, making it hard to see where the sources of CO2 came from.
B) Because these satellites only give us information on xCO2 and not CO2
C) Because these satellites have been optimised to obtain information on large scale terrestrial biosphere carbon fluxes.",C
"Why was it particularly important to measure levels of Aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic?

A) Because of the health impacts of aerosols which can deeply penetrate into human lungs and cause serious respiratory problems, which could then potentially increase the number of severe cases of COVID-19
B) So we can see what happens to aerosols during periods of reduced traffic and reduced industrial outputs, and see how they are transported",A
"Did aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed over Northern Italy after the implementation of COVID lockdown, increase or decrease?

A) Decrease
B) Increase",B
"Did in situ ground-based measurements of NO2 in Europe match up with the satellite data in the ICOVAC study?

A) Yes
B) No",A
"Why couldn’t Methane (CH4) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) measurements be estimated for the COVID Lockdowns?

A) Because the variability of these species is much higher, thus preventing any detection of a significant signal due to covid lockdown
B) Because there were not any local measurements for this these species available
C) Because these are trace gasses and so the amounts of them in the atmosphere are hard to measure accurately",A
"Why did concentrations of secondary pollutants such as ozone increase in some regions during COVID lockdowns?

A) Because of increase used of heating in residential buildings
B) Because of the reductions in NOx
C) Because of meteorological phenomenon",B
"What is the difference between weather and climate?

A) Climate is short term variations.
B) They are both the same
C) Climate is the average weather over long periods",C
"What could changing regional climates alter?

C) Water supply
D) Solar radiation levels","A, B, C"
